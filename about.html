				Calicut is the anglicised form of Kalikut. The Arabic for the Malayalam , Kozhikode. It is also called the Cock Fort.
				According to the historian, K.V Krishnan Iyer, the term means koyil (Palace) Kodu (Fortified). Anyhow, it is a
				historical town with a hoary past. From time immemorial, the city attracted travellers, with its charming physical
				features and prosperity. Even today , the glory that was Calicut has not faded. The political history of Kozhikode is a
				story of treacherous and ill conceived conspiracies hatched by the Western powers. Vasco De Gama landed at Kappad in May
				1498, as the leaders of a trade mission from Portugal and was received by the Zamorin himself.

				The history of Kozhikode district as an administrative unit begins from January 1957. When 
				the states of the Indian Union were reorganised on linguistic basis on 1st November, 1956, the
				 erstwhile Malabar district was separated from Madras state (Tamil Nadu) and added to the new unilingual 
				 state of Kerala. But malabar district was found to be too unwieldy for administrative purposes. Consequently 
				 the state government ordered the formation of three districts with certain changes in the boundaries of 
				 some of the taluks. The Kozhikode district thus came into existence on 1st January 1957,orginally consisting
				  of five taluks, Viz, Vadakara, Koyilandy, Kozhikode, Ernad & Tirur. With the formation of malapuram district
				   on 1st june 1969 & Wayandu on 1st November 1980, kozhikode district now consist of one revenue division , 
				   three taluks, twelve blocks, 78 panchayats and 117 villages.

				The city is surrounded by a lush green country side, rivers, scenic hills, beautiful beaches, historic sites and
				wildlife sanctuaries. Travellers like Marco Polo, the Italian Nicola de Conti, the Russian Afanas and the Arab Ibn
				Batuta mention Calicut in their travel writings. Kozhikode is the third most populous city of Kerala State. The city was
				traditionally known as the 'city of spices' for its trade in pepper, cardamom, cinnamon and ginger. In fact the
				Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama landed in 1498 at a beach near Calicut when he came searching for the spices of India.
				Kozhikode was traditionally ruled by the powerful Zamorins. Their descendants still live in the city.
